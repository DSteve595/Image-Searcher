#Image Searcher

Send anything from Google Image Search right from your favorite apps!

Bug reports and pull requests always welcome.

Free on the Play Store: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.stevenschoen.imagesearcher

Don't have the right picture for a message or email?
Attach a photo and select Image Searcher from the list. Then, search through Google Images' massive collection and pick what you want!
It's a lot quicker than searching for the image, downloading it, sharing it, and picking the app you were just in before you were interrupted.

Works great with Messaging, Hangouts, Gmail, and many others!
